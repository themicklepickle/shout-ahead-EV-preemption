A multi-agent AI emergency vehicle preemption system was created by extending the shout-ahead agent architecture with two emergency vehicle rule sets, which were learned using a layered, hybrid reinforcement and evolutionary machine-learning paradigm. When evaluated, the system excelled in increasing the average emergency vehicle speed and reducing the total emergency vehicle stop duration, while simultaneously having a competitively minimal disturbance on regular traffic. Notably, the experimental results exemplified the vitality of agent communication, justifying the use of a multi-agent system.
